The histogram is represented by a series of bars, where the height of each bar corresponds to a given value, and the width of the bar is assumed to be 1. The task is to find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed by any set of adjacent bars in the histogram.
                                For example to get the area of the first bar, the height is two and the width is 1. So, width = 2 X 1 = 2.

            <p class="mt-3">The first for loop iterates through all the elements of the array until the last 3 which is k in this example. This is because if it does not stop at the last 3 elements  it will return undefined since it goes out of the k length.</p>
            <p class="mt-3">A variable name max is made it, stores all the current iterations in nums</p>
            <p class="mt-3">The second for loop iterated through is j = i  + 1, and it will increase if the value of j is less than the value of `i + k`. This is to ensure that J gets the values ahead of i by k value . In this instance for example i will be at 1 and j will be at two numbers ahead which are 3 and -1. This is to get all the values in k=3.</p>

            <p class="mt-2">We  make a function called mergeKlists that takes in `lists` as its parameter.</p>
            <p class="mt-2">A variable called `previous` is assigned to a value which is null. This is to keep track of the merged linked list</p>
            <p class="mt-2">Then a for loop is declared to loop through the merged linked lists.</p>
            <p class="mt-2">For each linked lists we call the function `mergeTwolists` passing in the previous linked list and the current linked list as the argument</p>
            <p class="mt-2">After merging all the linked lists we return previous.</p>
            <p class="mt-3">Now we take the `mergeTwoLists` function that takes in two linked lists. `list1` and `list2,</p>
            <p class="mt-2">Then we create ListNode with a value of 0. This will act as a sentinel node and the tail node since both are assigned to the same values, which is a common technique used when working with linked lists. Sentinel is used to keep track of the head of the merged linked list, while tail is used to keep track of the end of the merged linked list. When we merge two linked lists, we need to keep track of the end of the merged list so that we can add new nodes to the end as we iterate through the two lists. We update it with each iteration of the while loop using tail = tail.next. This ensures that we always add new nodes to the end of the new linked list.</p>
            <p class="mt-2">After that we declare a while loop to iterate through both lists and add nodes to the new linked lists in the correct order. This while loop runs as long as both list1 and list2 have nodes that haven't been added to the new list yet.</p>
            <p class="mt-2">Inside the loop, we check which of the two lists has the smaller first value with the variable called canAddl1. We do this by comparing the .val property of the first node in each list.</p>
            <p class="mt-2">Then the first `If statement` checks if  list1 has the smaller value (or if the two values are equal), we add the first node from list1 to the new list and advance the pointer for list1 to the next node.</p>
            <p class="mt-2">Then the  `else statement` returns if list2 has the bigger value, we add the first node from list2 to the new list and advance the pointer for list2 to the next node.</p>
            <p class="mt-2">After adding a node to the new list, we advance the pointer for the tail to the next node in the new list. That is the  point of tail = tail.next is to update the tail variable to point to the last node in the newly merged linked list after each iteration of the while loop.            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">Once the loop is finished. This operation adds the remaining nodes in either list1 or list2 (if any) to the end of the new merged linked list. After all the nodes have been merged and added to the new linked list, the code return sentinel.next returns a reference to the first node in the new merged list. This will return the values in the newly sorted linked list in incrementing order.</p>
           <p class="mt-2">Then we return the new linked list</p>

                <p class="mt-1">This function called `merge` takes in two linked lists, left and right,</p>
                <p class="pt-3" >The first if statement checks if left is null. If it is, then we can simply return right </p>
                <p class="mt-3">The second if statement checks if right is null. If it is, then we can simply return left</p>
                <p class="mt-3">The third if statement checks if the value of the first node in left is less than the value of the first node in right. If it is, then we know that the first node in left should be the first node in the merged list. We recursively call merge with left.next and right, and set the next property of the current node in left to the result of that call. We then return left, since we know that the first node in the merged list is the first node in left. If none of the conditions are met then it is done to the right node.</p>
               
               
                <p class="mt-7">The next function called `helper` takes in the parameters `lists` which are the values, `start` parameter for the beginning index and `end` for the end index.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">The next if statement checks if `start` is equal to end. This line of code checks if the start index of the given linked list is equal to the end index. If they are equal, it means that there is only one linked list left to merge, and it returns that list. In other words, if the start and end indices are equal, there is only one list to merge, and we can return it directly without performing any further operations.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">The second if statement checks if start is less than end. If it is, then we calculate the midpoint of the range between start and end, and recursively call helper with start, mid, and lists. We also recursively call helper with lists, mid + 1 and end . It adds 1 to the midpoint mid because we want to include the element at the index mid in the left list and start the right list at the index mid + 1. We then return the result of calling merge with the two lists returned by these recursive calls. If none of the above conditions is met, then we can simply return null.</p>

This is done because the algorithm works by pushing elements onto a stack, and we need to ensure that the stack is emptied at the end of the algorithm. By adding a zero to the end of the heights array, we ensure that the stack will be emptied after processing all of the original heights.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">An empty array is declared to the variable name `stack`. This is used in the stack algorithm</p>

                <p class="mt-3">Then a while loop is declared. It is only executed if the stack is not empty, and the last element of the stack is bigger than heights[i]. For example: 6 is bigger than 2 and then 5 is bigger than 2 so the while loop will execute. This is used to stop the max area that it can calculate since the next iterated number is smaller.</p>
                <p class="mt-3">Then the stack is destructured to the value called `[pos, height]` and popped  </p>
                <p class="mt-3">It then gets the max value between the current `res` and between (i-pos) times height. We are using this formula because i is on the index on where it has started and pos is the current index of where the area is being stop calculated. This is to get the width of the area. The formula to get area is HEIGHT X WIDTH</p>
