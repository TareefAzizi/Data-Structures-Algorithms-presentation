                            <p class="mb-6 font-light text-gray-500 md:text-lg dark:text-gray-400">This Question is to solve the problem of finding the largest rectangular area in a given histogram. The histogram is represented by a series of bars, where the height of each bar corresponds to a given value, and the width of the bar is assumed to be 1. The task is to find the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed by any set of adjacent bars in the histogram.
                                For example to get the area of the first bar, the height is two and the width is 1. So, width = 2 X 1 = 2.

                <h2>Time and Space Complexity Analysis</h2>
                <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as the size of the input data increases. It is usually denoted by the big O notation (O(n)), where n is the size of the input. The following are some common time complexities:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>O(1) - Constant Time: An algorithm that takes the same amount of time to complete regardless of the input size. Examples include accessing an array element or performing a single arithmetic operation.</li>
                  <li>O(log n) - Logarithmic Time: An algorithm that takes time proportional to the logarithm of the input size. Examples include binary search or searching in a balanced binary search tree.</li>
                  <li>O(n) - Linear Time: An algorithm that takes time proportional to the input size. Examples include linear search or traversing an array.</li>
                  <li>O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time: An algorithm that takes time proportional to n times the logarithm of n. Examples include sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort.</li>
                  <li>O(n^2) - Quadratic Time: An algorithm that takes time proportional to the square of the input size. Examples include bubble sort and selection sort.</li>
                  <li>O(2^n) - Exponential Time: An algorithm that takes time proportional to 2 raised to the power of the input size. Examples include the brute force solution to the traveling salesman problem.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Space complexity refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm takes up as the size of the input data increases. It is also denoted by the big O notation (O(n)), where n is the size of the input. The following are some common space complexities:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>O(1) - Constant Space: An algorithm that takes up a fixed amount of memory regardless of the input size. Examples include swapping two variables or reversing an array in place.</li>
                  <li>O(n) - Linear Space: An algorithm that takes up space proportional to the input size. Examples include creating a new array to store the result of an operation on the input array.</li>
                  <li>O(n^2) - Quadratic Space: An algorithm that takes up space proportional to the square of the input size. Examples include creating a 2D array to store the result of a matrix multiplication.</li>

            <p class="mt-1">We  make a function called mergeKlists that takes in `lists` as its parameter.</p>
            <p class="mt-1">A variable called `previous` is assigned to a value which is null. This is to keep tracked of the merged linked list</p>
            <p class="mt-1">Then a for loop is declared to loop through the merged linked lists.</p>
            <p class="mt-1">For each linked lists we call the function `mergeTwolists` passing in the previous linked list and the curent linked list as the arguement</p>
            <p class="mt-1">After merging all the linked lists we return previous.</p>
            <p class="mt-3">Now we take the `mergeTwoLists` function that takes in two linked lists. `list1` and `list2,</p>
            <p class="mt-1">Then we create ListNode with a value of 0. This will act as a sentinel node, which is a common technique used when working with linked lists. A sentinel tracks the of the front of the list and the tail trackes the last values.</p>
            <p class="mt-1">After that we declare a while loop to iterate through both lists and adding nodes to the new linked lists in a correct order. This while loop runs as long as both list1 and list2 have nodes that haven't been added to the new list yet.</p>
            <p class="mt-1">Inside the loop, we check which of the two lists has the smaller first value. We do this by comparing the .val property of the first node in each list.</p>
            <p class="mt-1">Then the first `If statement` checks if If list1 has the smaller value (or if the two values are equal), we add the first node from list1 to the new list and advance the pointer for list1 to the next node.</p>
            <p class="mt-1">Then the second `else statement` returns if  list2 has the smaller value, we add the first node from list2 to the new list and advance the pointer for list2 to the next node.            </p>
            <p class="mt-1">After adding a node to the new list, we advance the pointer for tail to the next node in the new list.            </p>
            <p class="mt-1">Once the loop is finished, we add any remaining nodes from list1 or list2 to the end of the new list.            </p>
           <p class="mt-1">Then we return the new linked list</p>
